## Syntax Highlighters (for snippets)
When moving code from an IDE to paper for something like an assessment, black text on a white background can be harder to read compared to highlighted words. Highlighting terms and calls can make understanding a snippet a lot easier.

- [Basic highlighter](https://highlight.hohli.com/index.php)
    - No style selection
- [More advanced highlighter](https://pinetools.com/syntax-highlighter)
    - Style selection

## SQL

    - Breaks on blobs but is clean to use
- [SQLite Viewer (doesn't break on blobs)](https://sqliteviewer.flowsoft7.com/)
    - Similar to the one above but doesn't break on blobs (not as nice-looking)
- [Test small SQL commands (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server)](http://www.sqlfiddle.com)
    - Build a small schema and then execute commands based on the schema creation
    - Restricted to internal request character length
